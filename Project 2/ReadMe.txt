There are 2 source files in the folder:
1.)Assignment_k_means.ipynb
2.)AutoEncoder.ipynb

There are two Output file:
1.)kmeans_output.ascii: Contains the output of k-means on the original dataset.
2.)pca_output.ascii: Contains the output of k-means after the dataset is applied to the pca.

Most importantly, where ever the path of a file is mentioned, will have to provide the path of that file. there are 3 places where you will have to provide the path to the file in the first source code, and one place in the 2nd source code.

This code will only run in the jupyter notebook and need to have all the libraries imported in the file. If the libraries are not present you will need to install them.
Just in case the above file don't run i have provided the .py file with these files. 





References: 1.) For the auto Encoder I have refered from the following link to understand and impiment the autoencoder on out dataset.

For impliment various functions I have taken reference from various online sources to understand various concepts and impliment them in this assignment.
